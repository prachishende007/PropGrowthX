# 🏢 PropgrowthX – Machine Learning Internship Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the work completed during my internship as a **Machine Learning Engineer Intern** at **PropgrowthX**.  
The primary goal of this project was to build **data-driven machine learning models** to assist real estate investors by predicting **property prices** and **return on investment (ROI)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict **property prices** based on historical and market data  
- Estimate **ROI** to help investors make informed decisions  
- Apply end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing to model evaluation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Techniques:**  
  - Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning  

---

## 🔍 Key Features

### 📈 Property Price Prediction
- Built regression-based ML models to estimate property prices  
- Used features such as location, property size, amenities, and market trends  

### 💰 ROI Prediction for Investors
- Developed models to forecast expected return on investment  
- Enabled comparison of multiple real estate investment opportunities  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score  
- Applied cross-validation to improve model robustness and reduce overfitting
